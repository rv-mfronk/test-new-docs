# Quick Start
Ready to spin up some doc? This is just a sample of how to lay things out. For a proper treatment on the subject, refer to the [Doc Operations Guide](https://docs.rvapps.io/teams/doc).

For information about using the Nebula theme, refer to the [Nebula doc](https://docs.rvapps.io/products/v1/nebula).

For general information about VuePress, read all about it [here](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/).


<Note type="tip">

**Tip:** If you are creating a doc repo from scratch, you can use either the [doc-vuepress-subinstall](https://github.com/RedVentures/doc-vuepress-subinstall) (for a subinstall) or [doc-vuepress-template](https://github.com/RedVentures/doc-vuepress-template) (for a doc repo) repo as a template. To do so, select the repo from the **Repository template** field when creating the repo.
