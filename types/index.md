# Doc Types
What should you document? Anything that will benefit your team in its work! Consider onboarding materials, best practice guides, ADRs, support runbooks...Anything that would suffer in the event that the SME was unfortunately hit by a falling meteor.


Refer to the [Doc Operations and Standards Guide](https://docs.rvapps.io/teams/doc/doc-types/about.html) for more information about recommended content types.

## API specifications
The [API Specification](api-spec.md) page shows an example of displaying a Swagger/OpenAPI-style of doc from right within a doc project like this. But that isn't the only way you can do it. Consider generating doc directly from your code as an alternative. If you're using Golang, you can use the [go-swagger-template repository](https://github.com/RedVentures/go-swagger-template) to get up and running.
